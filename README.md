# java-web-bloop-sbt-spring-thyme-challenge-question-aes-encryption-scrypt-encode

## Description
A springboot secure web app with thymeleaf support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encrypted with AES and encoded with scrypt
to insure strong passwords.

Presents a register form to create an inMemoryUser.
Once the user is created it is given the `USER` role
by default and auto logged in.

Presents a reset form to reset passwords on any user,
by default the user is reassigned `USER` role and auto
logged in. Only restriction on passwords are they match;
all validation is done client side.

Uses a challenge question on password rest and user register
to verify user. Customizes user data class by extending the
UserDetailService.

Compiled and ran from build server `bloop`.
